funkGenie 1.0.1

  funkGenie is an example of a function generator running on Arduino Due. It
  is based on user MarkT's work at arduino forums on "Example of driving ADC
  and DAC from timer for regular sampling":
  http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=205096.0
  
  It can output sine, square, triangle and sawtooth waves. The sine wave is
  wavetable based while triangle, square and sawtooth are calculated directly.
  Linear interpolation is also done if necessary when in sine wave mode.
  
  funkGenie is far from perfect but does output fairly decent waveshapes up to
  a few kHz. At higher frequencies the shape of the wave gets less samples per
  cycle and will be distorted.
  
  Feel free to contact me if you have improvement ideas.
